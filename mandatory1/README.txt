This is a hand-in for NodeJS elective, fall 2022.

Known issues:
- Login only kind of works. You can technically log in, but nothing happens whne you do it.
- Editing is not protected, so anyone can edit the documentation pages at this point.
- There is no security of any kind.
- The "database" is just JacaScript file.
- Any edits made are lost if the server is restarted.
